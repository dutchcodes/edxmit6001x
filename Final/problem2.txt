Problem 2.1
You have the following class hierarchy:
class A(object):
    def foo(self):
        print('hi')
class B(A):
    def foo(self):
        print('bye')
          
Answer = ??? Had this wrong --> NOT Both of the Above

Problem 2.2
Consider the function f below. What is its Big O complexity?

def f(n):
    def g(m):
        m = 0
        for i in range(m):
            print(m)
    for i in range(n):
        g(n)

Answer = O(n)

Problem 2.3
A dictionary is an immutable object because its keys are immutable.

Answer = False, dict is mutable

Problem 2.4

def foo_one(n):
    """ Assume n is an int >= 0 """
    answer = 1.0
    while n > 1:
        answer *= n
        n -= 1
    return answer

def foo_two(n):
    """ Assume n is an int >= 0 """
    if n <= 1: 
        return 1.0
    else: 
        return n*foo_two(n-1)
        
Answer: The worst case Big Oh time complexity of foo_one and foo_two are the same.

Problem 2.5
The complexity of 1^n+n^4+4n+4 is

Answer = Polynomial
